# SIEM Analysis Training Simulator

## Overview

This is an interactive cybersecurity training simulator designed to help security analysts practice SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) event analysis and incident response skills.

## Training Objective

Analyze 25 security events and correctly classify each one as:
- **Malicious** - Confirmed security threat requiring immediate action
- **Suspicious** - Potentially malicious activity requiring further investigation  
- **False Positive** - Benign activity that triggered an alert but poses no threat

## How It Works

1. **Event Analysis**: Review each security event, examining timestamps, source/destination IPs, event descriptions, and detailed logs
2. **Investigation**: Use your knowledge of:
   - Company security policies (available in the documentation panel)
   - Employee access rights and work schedules
   - Network infrastructure and approved systems
   - External threat intelligence sources
3. **Classification**: Make a determination on each event based on your analysis

## Key Learning Areas

- **Policy Compliance**: Understanding what activities are authorized vs. unauthorized
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Identifying unusual patterns in user behavior
- **Threat Intelligence**: Recognizing indicators of compromise
- **Risk Assessment**: Distinguishing between genuine threats and false alarms
- **Time-based Analysis**: Considering business hours, work schedules, and timing context

## Company Context

You are analyzing events from **ACMECORP Inc.**, a technology consulting firm with:
- 35 employees across 3 locations (New York, Austin, London)
- Hybrid work model with remote access capabilities
- Standard business applications and security policies

## Scoring

Your performance is evaluated based on accuracy of event classification. The goal is to correctly identify all malicious activities while minimizing false positives that could waste analyst time.

## Skills Developed

- SIEM log analysis
- Incident triage and prioritization
- Security policy interpretation
- Threat hunting fundamentals
- Risk-based decision making
